# React Expense Tracker

Small demo app which allows a user to add expenses to a simple interface.

## What it looks like

## What it does

- Allows you to add an expense to the app
- Allows you to filter expenses by year
- Allows you to see a summary of each month as a chart

_Currently does not persist expenses between page loads. Might add that at some point._
